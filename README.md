Farm Locations
The site mostly target laptop/pc owners or tablet users for usage.
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Community/Farmers-Market/sphi-rwax The Api used was that of a list of farmers market in the prince georges county.
The site visualizes using the leaflet library and when the list is generated or searched it shows the marker of the location as well.
This will aid both customers/retailers and people trying to set up farms to either find a better/nearby place to get their products or set up to avoid competition.
