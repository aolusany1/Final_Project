    <h1>About The Page</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the website!.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <b>The site requests to an api that has a collection of farms in a certain location as well as their location and how to contact them and also some of the products they offer.
        The site visualizes the location of the various farms with the use of markers when they are searched up or a list is randomly generated. For customers or people looking for products this can help reduce searching time as they can find ones close by.
        And for others seeking to start their own farms they can choose to either be close or away from other farms to avoid competition. Very simple to use the user can first load the dataset then either generate a random list for recommendations or type in a search though its limited to a certain county.
